[CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) parser for Clojure/Script.

TODO

[![Dependency Status](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/57df6c1b037c2000458f785a/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.versioneye.com/user/projects/57df6c1b037c2000458f785a)

## Rationale

TODO add links to Monadic Parsing and Parsing with Derivatives papers.

Instaparse is very powerful and well done, but due to its tradeoffs it [starts having issues around 20k-200k chars](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse/issues/131#issuecomment-209204750) (one of the test files is 10M, Commonmark C implementation eats it in couple of seconds).

So, one alternative would be to implement a small parser combinators library (for fun) or use one of the following:
- https://github.com/youngnh/parsatron
- https://github.com/blancas/kern
- https://github.com/van-clj/zetta-parser

Kern looks best.

## Usage

TODO

## Roadmap

- [ ] Pass all the spec test cases
- [ ] Handle pathological inputs: markdown-it test suite
- [ ] ClojureScript port
