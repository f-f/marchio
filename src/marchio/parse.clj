;; --  Parsing strategy

;; Parsing has two phases:

;; 1. Input is split by lines, that are then consumed. While doing this the
;;    block structure of the document is constructed: paragraphs, list items,
;;    block quotes, etc. Text is assigned to those blocks but not parsed.
;;    Also, a map of internal links is built from link reference definitions.

;; 2. Raw contents of paragraphs and headings are parsed into seqs of Markdown
;;    inline elements (spans, links, strings, etc), using the map of link refs.
;;    The documents is always represented as a Tree of blocks. The root of the
;;    Tree is a Document block, which may have a number of children, which could
;;    then have children, etc.
;;    Blocks could be 'open' or 'closed'. Last child of a block is considered
;;    'open', meaning that the next lines of input can alter its content.


;; -- Phase 1: Block Structure

;; Each line that is processed has an effect on the tree. Every line may alter
;; the document in atleast one of the following ways:

;; 1. One or more open blocks may be closed.
;; 2. One or more new blocks may be created as children of the last open block.
;; 3. Text may be added to the last (deepest) open block remaining on the tree.

;; For each line, this procedure is executed:

;; 1. Given that the line must satisfy a certain condition to keep a block open
;;    (e.g. a block quote requires a > character, a paragraph requires a
;;    non-blank line), iterate through the open blocks - starting from the root
;;    and down to the last open block through last-children-path - and try to
;;    match the condition of each block.
;;    But can't close unmatched blocks, there may be a lazy continuation line.
;; 2. Look for new block starts (e.g. > for a block quote).
;;    On encountering a new block start, close any blocks unmatched in step 1
;;    before creating the new block as a child of the last matched block.
;; 3. Look at the remainder of the line: thi is text that can be incorporated
;;    into the last open block (paragraph, code block, heading, or raw HTML).

;; Block types: Document, BlockQuote, ListItem, FencedCode,
;; IndentedCode, RawHtmlBlock, Reference

; 'finalize' is run when the block is closed.
; 'continue' is run to check whether the block is continuing
; at a certain line and offset (e.g. whether a block quote
; contains a `>`.  It returns 0 for matched, 1 for not matched,
; and 2 for "we've dealt with this line completely, go to next."}})
